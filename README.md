### Personas/Scenarios

1.  **User Profile / Persona 1:** Joe is a FEMA employee who wants to learn more about possible climate change impacts for prisons across the United States in order to assess their preparedness for emergency events like wildfires and other devastating heat-related events. He needs access to a geovisualization that offers a synoptic view on the impacts of wildfires and rising heat indexes to prisons in different FEMA regions in order to *compare* and *rank* regions that may need more immediate emergency preparedness action. He wants to *associate* regional *trends* and *patterns* around climate change impacts on prisons with local city and town efforts to create emergency preparedness plans in response to climate change impacts and disasters. 

**Scenario 1 (ONE-WAY LEARNING / OVERLAY):** Upon arriving at the geovisualization, Joe is greeted with a panel that allows her to choose the font size and colors used in the visualizations and details. He selects his options and clicks next. It brings him to a one-way learning material, a story that introduces the map and connections between prisons and climate change impacts using the example of Hurricane Katrina, as well as orienting him to the overlays of different climate impacts (potential heat indexes, wildfire risk). He clicks next again, which offers another story about the connection between disability, incarceration, and climate change impacts using the example of psychiatric facilities, and orienting him to how to use filters to modify the points included on the map. Joe didn’t realize that many psychiatric facilities do not have emergency preparedness plans for climate change impacts and decides to include them in his future analysis. He clicks next once again to reach the “Explore” portion of the map. He is confronted with a map of the United States. He begins visual analysis by selecting the FEMA regions *overlay* and wildfire risk *overlay* to assess wildfire risk across the various FEMA regions which gives him a county level overview of wildfire risk. Joe assesses that FEMA region 9 *ranks* as one of the regions with the highest risk. He *zooms* into FEMA region 9, which includes California. He *filters* to include the points for detention facilities, prisons, jails, and psychiatric facilities, to *compare* facilities across the region, looking for *clusters* where local executive action on emergency preparedness plans may make an outsized impact on improving potential conditions in incarceration facilities facing climate change impacts. 

2. **User Profile / Persona 2:** Sally is a visually impaired environmental justice advocate working in Louisiana who wants to pass legislation requiring prisons and psychiatric facilities to create emergency response plans that adequately respond to the increasing threats of climate change impacts on disabled and incarcerated people. She needs access to a geovisualization that offers a synoptic view on the variety of possible climate change impacts on these institutions in order to *compare* and *rank* different facilities by vulnerability to particular impacts (like rising heat indexes and flooding) to identify *outliers* that may need rapid action and detect *patterns* that may show the vulnerability of these institutions to climate change impacts. 

**Scenario 2 (RETRIEVE):** Upon arriving at the geovisualization, the Sally is greeted with a panel that allows her to choose the font size and colors used in the visualizations and details. After she has chosen a large font size and color hues that are suitable to her needs, she uses the toolbar to skip ahead to the “Explore” portion of the map. She is already familiar with how to use the map and is using it on her computer to explore climate change impacts in Louisiana in order to make a policy report. She begins visual analysis by selecting an overlay of potential heat indexes by year 2100. She includes *filters* for prisons, detention centers, and psychiatric facilities and then *comparing* points across the state of Louisiana with other nearby states. She assesses that incarceration facilities in southern Louisiana *ranks* as one of the most vulnerable regions to rising temperatures. She then *retrieves* detailed information about the Terrebonne Criminal Justice Complex in Houma, Louisiana, identifying it as an *outlier* that needs rapid action to protect the safety of those incarcerated or detained in psychiatric institutions.

**Scenario 3 (SEARCH):** Sally is having a day with a terrible migraine that limits her ability to look at a computer screen. It’s another hot day in the middle of the summer, and she is feeling climate anxiety about the potential impacts of wildfires on her friends incarcerated at Mariposa County Detention Facility in Mariposa, CA. She uses her keyboard to toggle to the toolbar to reach the “Explore” portion of the map. She begins by *searching* for Mariposa County Detention Facility using her keyboard. The map *zooms* to California and highlights the detention facility. She then selects an *overlay* for wildfire risk. The screen reader reads the detailed information that she *retrieves* about the facility. She assesses that it *ranks* in the 99th percentile for wildfire risk and makes a plan to check in on her friends’ mental health and physical safety more often during the height of fire season in California.
