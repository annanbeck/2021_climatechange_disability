### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Target User Profile (persona)—we might want to make her more general audience
Sharon Streeter/ First year graduate student in the social sciences
Sharon has just finished her undergraduate work in philosophy but changed disciplines to geography to fulfill her interest in the human/social phenomena of the world. She knows she is interested in incarceration. She is looking to develop insights into the ways that incarceration and disability function in the era of climate change as a driver of precarity. She wants to understand the scale of the problem nationally, be able to assess and compare coastal versus land-locked areas in terms of risk, and see trends and patterns in terms of different kinds of risks in different areas. She also wants to be able to see how these risks might increase in the future with the increase in large scale weather events because of climate change.

    2. When she arrives at the map she is prompted with a series of stories that outline five different stories of times when large scale weather events have placed incarcerated and/or disabled populations into precarious and deadly positions. These stories narrate what the map is showing so act as both a way to contextualize what the map is showing and offer an in to understand the symbology of the map—highlights a red dot for a case where a prison population was subjected to large amounts of smoke from a fire, for example. After this initial affordance, she is able to interact with the map herself. The story portion left her in New Orleans but she wants to see what is happening nationally so she zooms out. MORE
