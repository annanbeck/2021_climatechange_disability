### Final Proposal
1. Persona/Scenario
    1. Target User Profile (persona)—we might want to make her more general audience
    Persona 1 / Sharon Streeter/ First year graduate student in the social sciences
    Sharon has just finished her undergraduate work in philosophy but changed disciplines to geography to fulfill her interest in the human/social phenomena of the world. She knows she is interested in incarceration. She is looking to develop insights into the ways that incarceration and disability function in the era of climate change as a driver of precarity. She wants to understand the scale of the problem nationally, be able to assess and compare coastal versus land-locked areas in terms of risk, and see trends and patterns in terms of different kinds of risks in different areas. She also wants to be able to see how these risks might increase in the future with the increase in large scale weather events because of climate change.

    (Scenario) When she arrives at the map she is prompted with a series of stories that outline five different stories of times when large scale weather events have placed incarcerated and/or disabled populations into precarious and deadly positions. These stories narrate what the map is showing so act as both a way to contextualize what the map is showing and offer an in to understand the symbology of the map—highlights a red dot for a case where a prison population was subjected to large amounts of smoke from a fire, for example. After this initial narrative affordance, she is able to interact with the map herself. The story portion left her in New Orleans but she wants to see what is happening nationally so she zooms out. 

    2. Persona 2 / Jake Johnson / Disability rights activist
    Jake is a disability rights activist who is trying to convince legislators about the risks and dangers that disabled people face because of climate change. He knows that disabled people are on the frontlines of climate disasters, along with incarcerated people, since both face systemic governmental neglect and are often excluded from disaster evacuation plans. In order to show these risks to legislators, Jake wants to share case studies of disasters when disabled people were disproportionately impacted by climate change and quantify these impacts at different scales. He wants to compare and rank the regionally differential impacts of climate change on disabled and incarcerated communities to discover patterns and trends at various governmental scales. 

    (Scenario) When he arrives at the map Jake cycles through a series of narratives of disasters that disproportionately impacted disabled and incarcerated peoples, orienting him to the map and detailing how disabled and incarcerated people are on the frontlines of climate change. Once he clicks through the stories, he is able to explore the map at various scales. Since he is trying to convince a legislator from Racine, WI, he searches for Racine on the map to assess whether there are any prisons or mental institutions that would be disproprotionately impacted by climate change.
